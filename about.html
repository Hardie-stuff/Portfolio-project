          I am a twenty-something year old rolling stone who spent their
          childhood doodling and writing, and have now managed to turn it into a
          part-time job and full-time passion. Or, as my Twitter bio says, I'm
          just a creative who's desperatively trying to create something before
          the late stage capitalistic ennui drowns me.
          <br />
          <br />
          My sister and I were bred and reared by two ecccentric editors who
          treated us to a nomadic childhood, moving every few years from one
          quaint little dorp to the next. Little wonder that we both became avid
          readers ourselves and after devouring every appropriate book in our
          library, I began writing and illustrating my own stories. Many pay
          homage to the people we knew for a brief moment and the places we
          lived in and grew to love. Fortunately, both parents have always loved
          nature and quiet, so I was blessed to live in some of the most
          beautiful towns, in the beautiful houses my mother renovated. Although
          always exciting and full of wonder, this transient life did make for
          an unusual chilhood which in turn made for an unusual child.
          <br />

          I draw and write because I can’t afford therapy. I create scenes that
          horrify me as well as ones which comfort me. Sometimes one piece will
          do both. Sometimes I simply draw what I want to see and feel for
          myself. I don’t actually know why I draw, I just know I always have
          and it’s one of the only things that makes me genuinely happy. Even
          when it’s horrific, violent, and awful. As for writing, I have always
          wanted to tell a full story -- more than a simple image could. It has
          always been one of my dreams to create a story that could resonate
          with others, as so many stories have for me. As for my other dream, I
          wish to be underwater for as long as it’s possible, where it’s quiet.
