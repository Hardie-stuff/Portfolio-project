          <p class="mb-5">
            <strong>Saudade</strong> is a personal anthology of short stories
            and journal entries. Many of the stories are inspired by dreams,
            which have always been vivid and feature-length. Other stories are
            typed from the pages of personal journals, jotted down over the
            years. Some are born from a mere flicker of inspiration which burnt
            out before they grew into something more. But through all of them is
            woven the theme which ties them all together: "saudade" or, in other
            words,
            <strong
              >a sad state of intense longing for someone or something that is
              absent</strong
            >.
            <br />
            Within this collection is
            <em>Stoicism and Midnight Swims</em>, a story about a young woman
            who goes night-swimming in the rock pools by the ocean, and finds
            herself being watched by her university philosophy tutor;
            <em>Bitter Sangria</em>, a journal entry detailing the first real
            heartbreak after a several week long, international love across
            countries; <em>Cherub</em>, a novella about two university friends
            who make a deal with some devils to reach true Nirvana in the Old
            Wing, currently under restoration;
            <em>Graves for the Hands You Can't Hold </em>, a short horror story
            about the woods behind a guest house and the shallow graves found
            there without bodies.
            <br />
            Each story is accompanied by artwork and illustration, and notes
            which give insight into their respective origins and inspirations.

          <h3 class="mb-3" id="succubus">Succubus</h3>
          <p class="mb-5">
            <strong>Succubus</strong> tells the story of Suda, a solitary girl
            who sees the typical challenges of teenage life through an atypical
            lens. As Suda performs in her waking life the milestones of
            adolescence and adulthood - making friends, going to parties,
            falling in love and lust - each thought, feeling and experience
            filters through to settle onto her subconscious, where it blooms
            into life. After a difficult move Suda makes a new friend, one she
            feels real, rare love for, but their relationship is shattered at
            his birthday party, when he drunkenly confesses his love to her and
            simultaneously gropes her (all while he believing her to be asleep).
            He swears no memory of it, and Suda starts the new school year
            ensconced in crystallised contempt. Only to learn that since
            confronting him, Issei is dead.
            <br />
            Suda retreats into herself, a place where she can make sense of the
            world and all its awe and horror. The novel swells with rich
            dreamscapes, - of thick black pools with disembodied hands oozing
            white, of tsunamis and lighthouses, of giant fish with weeping
            mouths, of alabaster angels. Suda’s waking world is one familiar and
            alien, whose era, cultures and context are unanchored, swaying and
            merging like strands of kelp in a dense forest. In Suda’s world the
            urban and the natural, the digital and the manual, the modern and
            the timeless blend co- exist seamlessly. The characters are at once
            completely real - their millennial confidences, insecurities, and
            pretensions are immediately recognisable - but at the same time they
            are mere cardboard characters, the background to the iridescent mind
            of Suda. She is a character uniquely alone. It is a novel much like
            an aquarium: water is ever-present, and while the body of it is
            floating and dreamy, the edges are hard, defined, contained. This is
            in essence a coming of age novel that explores identity, sex,
            dreams, consent, be trayal and body horror. And seeping through
            every page is water.

          <h3 class="mb-3" id="primordial">Primordial Soup</h3>
          <p class="mb-5">
            <strong>Primordial Soup</strong> is a raw and at times absurd
            graphic novel about Ruth and her untreated depression. She's tried
            to treat it, but she can't afford therapy and the medication gives
            her night terrors and vertigo. So she tries to soldier on and not
            acknowledge it too much, not let it show, for fear of being a burden
            to her family. But for Ruth, things are hanging on by a very thin
            thread. <br />
            Cape Town is a beautiful but brutal city, full of opportunity but
            only behind an enormous pay-wall. At 27 she is working three jobs,
            all demeaning, while still relying on her aging father to help with
            rent. All her friends are in the same boat and wrestling with their
            own mental health crises, often exacerbating strained relationships.
            Her boyfriend is sweet but doesn't get it, and when her career break
            finally arrives, in an exciting new country, he tells her he needs
            "to figure himself out on his own". She gets ready to give it all up
            for something more, but when her plans fall away, she has nothing
            left to give. And it all takes place during a deadly pandemic and
            the sixth mass extinction. <br />So she decides to return the sea.
            She withdraws all her life savings (all R4 200 of it) and, after
            neatly packing away her belongings, takes a trip to Laangebaan to
            spend a solo weekend. Not fully committed to dying, she takes a deep
            dive and stays there a while, and becomes a fish.
